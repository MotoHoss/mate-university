MATE University
===============

MATE University is targeted at all levels of developers (including
beginners) to learn how to develop new panel applets, Caja (file manager)
extensions, pluma (text editor) and eom (image viewer) plugins, etc. to
expand the already powerful MATE Desktop experience.

MATE University has a strict admissions policy. MATE University 
invites you to visit, kick off your shoes and type!
By strict we mean strict.
    "Anybody that wants to can and that's final."
In the tech-school folder of this package are some hopefully helpful
primers for those who fingers ache from duckduckgo and company.
Dive in! The water is warm! Be helpful! If the MATE devs find your
work useful, neat, and clean they may add it to the master branch!
