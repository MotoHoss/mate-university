MATE University has a strict admissions policy. This policy can be found
while you are in tech-school. We at MATE Universtiy invite you to visit.
By strict we mean strict.
    "Anybody that wants to can and that's final."
In the tech-school folder of this package are some hopefully helpful
primers for those who fingers ache from duckduckgo and company.
Dive in! The water is warm! Be helpful! Thanks.
