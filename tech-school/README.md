tech-school-user-guide
----------

  MATE University invites you to visit, kick off your shoes and type!
The MATE team does indeed consider helpful documentation a priority. Now
that the team has released in most (if not all the distributions) it is
time to begin to provide that helpful documentation.

  This portion of tech-school is designed to show you how the MATE
team works inside the code to do exactly this:

  "Provide helpful documentation."

  MATE wants this documentation to be useful for developers and regular
users and even for those who like to read the fine manuals! We will
begin tech-school by showing how we will build the "mate-user-guide"
by introducing the concepts and code that make it practical to produce
accurate, adequate, and quality documentation.
